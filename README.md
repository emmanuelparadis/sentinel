# sentinel

This package has functions to analyse Sentinel data. It has two main components:

- a number of functions to search Copernicus and download products;
- a classification procedure with a probabilistic k-means algorithm;
- several tools to analyse GIS and remote sensing data.

These are all in development. More to come soon.
